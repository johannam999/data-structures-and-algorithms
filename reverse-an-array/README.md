# Reverse an Array
The goal of this challenge was to revert the array not useing the reverse() method. The solution for it was to use a for loop to iterate throught the values inside the array. Then I used pop() function to remove the last value of each array and push it into a new array. I decremented for loop to avoid loosing values from the array as the pop() menthod mutates the array.
